This study presents a novel quantum image encryption algorithm, using a
3D chaotic map and controlled qubit-level scrambling operations. The newly
proposed 3D-BNM chaotic map effectively reduces the degradation of chaotic
dynamics resulting from the finite word length effect. It facilitates the generation
of highly unpredictable random sequences and enhances chaotic performance.
The systemâ€™s efficacy is additionally enhanced by the inclusion of a SHA-256 hash
function. Initially, classical plain images are converted into their quantum equivalents
using the Novel Enhanced Quantum Representation (NEQR) model. The
Generalized Quantum Arnold Transformation (GQAT) is then applied to disrupt
the coordinate information of the quantum image. Subsequently, to diffuse the
pixel values of the scrambled image, XOR operations are performed using pseudorandom
sequences generated by the 3D-BNM chaotic map. Furthermore, to
enhance the randomness and reduce the correlation among the pixels in the resulting
cipher image, a controlled qubit-level scrambling operation is employed. The
encryption process utilizes fundamental quantum gates such as C-NOT and CCNOT.
